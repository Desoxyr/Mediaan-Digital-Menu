# Analysis
This is the analysis of the Mediaan Digital Menu. It consists out of the following steps:
- User Stories
- Business Processes
- Stakeholder Analysis

## User Stories

_“User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.”_

User stories are not a functional description. They make clear what the end user wants or requires and describes why they need it. Their aim is to get the client and developers to be on the same page. Below, our user stories are grouped per stakeholder. 
  
  

#### Owner

1. As a restaurant owner, I want customers to order online by scanning a QR code so that their orders can be processed quick and smoothly.
2. As a restaurant owner, I want to be able to add and remove tables that have their own QR code so that servers can deliver food to the correct customers.

## Business Processes 
A business process is a collection of tasks designed to create a service or product. Each step in a business process changes the product by adding value. The steps contain clearly defined inputs and a single output. These inputs are made up of all of the factors which contribute (either directly or indirectly) to the added value of a service or product.

Once completed, the business process accomplishes an organisational goal.

### How a business process relates to software applications?  
With a software application you are changing the processes of your company. You can shorten the duration of time intensive tasks by using software. For example calculating the cost of something. A computer can quickly pull up existing data and execute complicated calculations. But also with the ordering from the food. When a waiter has to go to the customer it costs a lot of time to get the things the customer wants. The customer can send it with the application and the kitchen staff directly have it. So the waiter only has to bring it to the customer. The other tasks will all be automated.

### Does your software automate a task, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform?

Our software automates a task because it makes it possible to run a restaurant without having any human interaction in the process of ordering food. It does this by automating the food ordering process in such a way that no one needs to go to the table of the client to register the food they want to order. Instead the clients can order the food themselves by making use of our software. Our software also makes it a lot easier to keep track of the restaurant’s stock because it keeps track of which items are still available by looking if the ingredients this item needs are still in stock.

### Which roles are involved in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence?  
The roles that our program will influence are those of the waiter, kitchen staff and manager. Our software will automate the part of the communication between customer and waiter, manage the orders for the kitchen and almost fully automated stock management.

## Stakeholder Analysis
In the stakeholder analysis we identify all the internal people and teams that the project will involve. We will describe some of their personas, influence, and interests.

The term “stakeholder' refers to the people or groups affected by a software development project. Stakeholders exist both within the organization and outside of it. They may be end users, or they might simply be affected by the process. Either way they have a vested interest in the final product.

One of the main stakeholders is our client Mediaan. Their goals are to end up with an application that automates the ordering process and facilitates menu management and stock management in an easy manner.

All restaurant employees are also stakeholders. Customers are affected because their ordering experience changes. They want to order their desired food quickly and easily. By streamlining the ordering process they can order their food more efficiently and receive their order faster.

  The waiter’s job changes from taking orders to mainly delivering the finished orders. When an order has been placed it becomes visible for the kitchen staff in an online portal. Instead of receiving the orders from the waiter, they have to check this portal and continuously update order statuses. The kitchen staff can also keep track of the remaining stock more easily, as it is updated whenever a dish is ordered.

The Manager and chef can update the menu in an online portal. Because part of the waiter’s role becomes unnecessary, the manager can save costs by reducing the amount of waiters.

Lastly we as developers are also stakeholders ourselves. Our goal is to create a fully functioning and well tested application. In conjunction with our education, we also want to complete various learning outcomes and explore new techniques. Our teachers are stakeholders indirectly, as they will judge the final outcome and grade us accordingly. We are limited by our previous experience and the time we are given on a weekly basis over the course of the semester.
