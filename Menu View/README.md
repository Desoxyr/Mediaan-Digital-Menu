# Menu View

This is the Menu View of the Digital Menu project. The Menu View allows customers to browse a menu and select their desired items. Food is separated into categories, which are fully customisable in the [Management View](https://github.com/Desoxyr/Mediaan-Digital-Menu/tree/master/Management%20View).

Customers can view and adjust their selection in the shopping cart. After optionally adding a tip they can place their order which is then send to the [Kitchen View](https://github.com/Desoxyr/Mediaan-Digital-Menu/tree/master/Kitchen%20View).

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run the command

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. 

For the full functionality the other microservices also need to be running.
