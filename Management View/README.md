# Management View

This is the Management View of the Digital Menu project. The Management View allows the staff of a restaurant to customise the menu.

Both dishes and categories can be created and deleted using a simple form. Images may be provided using a URL. A dish can contain as many ingredients as desired which will automatically be subtracted from the stock when that dish is ordered. 

Lastly there's an overview of tables and their QR codes. When customers scan one of these codes their device will automatically be linked to a table. The kitchen can see what table an order belongs. 

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run the command

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser. 

For the full functionality the other microservices also need to be running.
