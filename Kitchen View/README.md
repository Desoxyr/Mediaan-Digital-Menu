# Kitchen View

This is the Kitchen View of the Digital Menu project. The main purpose of the Kitchen View is to present the orders to the kitchen staff. The orders are color coded based on their status. Orders that have been fully completed are shown separately.

Another functionality of the Kitchen View is to update the stock. Employees see an overview of the remaining ingredients. Whenever a dish is ordered the system can subtract a desired amount from the inventory. When necessary the inventory can be manually updated.

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run the command

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser. 

For the full functionality the other microservices also need to be running.
